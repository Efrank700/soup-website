        Registration is officially over: 52 teams have signed up for our tournament! If you'd like to be on the waitlist, fill the form out below. If a team drops their spot, we will then offer spots in the order of the list.

        Payment must be received within 6 weeks of registration date to secure your spot. For teams that preregistered, you have six weeks from the start of registration. If your team is on the waitlist, there is no need to submit payment until we've informed you that we'll be able to grant you a spot in the competition. Registration fees are $60 for first team, and $50 for each additional team.
